I am a third-year Computer Science PhD student at the [Institute of AI in Management](https://www.som.lmu.de/ai/en/) at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/). I am advised by [Prof. Stefan Feuerriegel](https://www.som.lmu.de/ai/en/institute/contact-page/stefan-feuerriegel-840c1071.html). I am also an affiliated member of the [Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML)](https://www.mcml.ai/). Prior to my PhD, I completed my MSc degree at [University of Cologne](https://uni-koeln.de/en/) and my BSc at [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/home). I also gained extensive experience in industry through internships in data science/ML and consulting.

My current interests focus on developing and applying (causal) machine learning methods for *data-driven decision-making*, particularly in business contexts and addressing social challenges. I am also interested in the intersection of causal inference, machine learning, and social computing. I am passionate about doing work that addresses real-world problems, leading to meaningful improvements in decision-making.
